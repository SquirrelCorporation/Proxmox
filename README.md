These scripts empower users to create a Linux container or virtual machine interactively, providing choices for both simple and advanced configurations. The basic setup adheres to default settings, while the advanced setup gives users the ability to customize these defaults. 

Options are displayed to users in a dialog box format. Once the user makes their selections, the script collects and validates their input to generate the final configuration for the container or virtual machine.
